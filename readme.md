### Companion test app for the Forgerock Service Broker

This project contains a test app that can be pushed to Cloud Foundry and bound the the Forgerock Service Broker.  The bound test app can then participate in oauth 2 flows.

Specifically, the broker allows the creation of an [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant Process](https://backstage.forgerock.com/#!/docs/openam/13/admin-guide/chap-oauth2#figure-oauth2-client-cred)  

See installation and use instructions below.


<h3>Getting the Code</h3>

<p>The central project repository lives on the ForgeRock Bitbucket Server at 
<a href="https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/CLOUD/repos/forgerock-service-broker-testapp">https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/CLOUD/repos/forgerock-service-broker-testapp</a>.</p>

<p>Mirrors exist elsewhere (for example GitHub) but all contributions to the project are managed by using pull requests 
to the central repository.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get the code - if you want to run the code unmodified you can simply clone the central repo (or a 
reputable mirror):</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://stash.forgerock.org/cloud/forgerock-service-broker-testapp.git
</code></pre>

<p>If, however, you are considering contributing bug fixes, enhancements, or modifying the code you should fork the project
 and then clone your private fork, as described below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an account on <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com">BackStage</a> - You can use these credentials to create pull requests, report bugs, and
download the enterprise release builds.</li>
<li>Log in to the Bitbucket Server using your BackStage account credentials. </li>
<li>Fork the <code>forgerock-service-broker-testapp</code> project. This will create a fork for you in your own area of Bitbucket Server. Click on your 
profile icon then select 'view profile' to see all your forks. </li>
<li>Clone your fork to your machine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Obtaining the code this way will allow you to create pull requests later. </p>


###How to use the app
   
1. push the app to Cloud Foundry
  
  Clone the testapp, then from the test app project directory:  
 <code>cf push frtestapp</code>
